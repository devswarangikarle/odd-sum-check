# odd-sum-check
On an island, people only use odd numbers and avoid even numbers. A man visits the island and tells them that he used k distinct positive odd numbers to build his boat. The people ask the man to give them the number n, and they want to determine if the number n can be represented as a sum of k distinct positive odd numbers or not.
